# Financial-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
#### Machine Learning project that applies SMOTE to handle class imbalance and compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for fraud detection. Includes full preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC), and insights on model performance.
#### This project focuses on handling highly imbalanced data using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and evaluating multiple machine learning models for fraud detection. The dataset contains a very small number of fraud cases, which makes model evaluation challenging without proper resampling.

## What This Project Includes

1) Data preprocessing and cleaning
2) Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
3) Training three models: </br>
  a) Logistic Regression </br>
  b) Random Forest </br>
  c) XGBoost </br>
4) Evaluation using: </br>
  a) Precision </br>
  b) Recall </br>
  c) F1-score </br>
  d) ROC-AUC </br>
  e) Confusion Matrix </br>

5) Visualization and comparison of model performance

6) Goal: To explore how resampling techniques like SMOTE improve fraud detection performance and to compare different models on imbalanced classification tasks.
